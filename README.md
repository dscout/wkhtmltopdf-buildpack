# wkhtmltopdf Buildpack

This is a [Heroku buildpack][0] for bundling a compatible [wkhtmltopdf][1]
binary with your environment.

## Versions

* Buildpack:   `0.2`
* wkhtmltopdf: `0.12.3`

## Usage

This buildpack only installs wkhtmltopdf, it isn't very useful by itself. You'll
probably want to use it as part of a multi-buildpack. Here is an example using
the Ruby buildpack.

```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:set 'https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-multi.git'
$ echo 'https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby.git' >> .buildpacks
$ echo 'https://github.com/teamkudoz/wkhtmltopdf-buildpack.git' >> .buildpacks
$ git add .buildpacks
$ git commit -m 'Add multi-buildpack'
```

### Clearing Repo Cache

Remember to clean your repository cache if you are updating the version of
buildpack. To do that, run:

```bash
$ heroku plugins:install https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo.git
$ heroku repo:purge_cache -a appname
```

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues when trying to deploy with this buildpack, make sure your
app is running on `cedar-14` or `heroku-16`. You can check this with:

```bash
$ heroku stack
```
